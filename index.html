		<p>Welcome to my webpage!</p>
		<p>I wanted to make my website about photography because this is what I'm passionate about.</p>
		<p>I started doing photography when I was 14. I took a photography course both my freshman and senior year. I hope to catch your eye with some of the images I took and aslo some of the images I've seen.</p>
