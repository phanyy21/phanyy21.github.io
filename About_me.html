<p>My name is Stephany Hernandez. My friends and family gave me many nicknames but they call me Phany the most. I am a big fan of art and photography and have been doing both since the age of 14. Some of my work is current and some of my work is from when I first started. I am trying to get better as the days go by. I have so much knowlege of what I'm doing, but I'm also learning even more as I keep doing it. If you'd like to see more pictures just come see me! :D</p>
